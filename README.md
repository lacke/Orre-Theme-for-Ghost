# Orre

Orre is a [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) theme inspired somewhat by [exposure.so](http://exposure.so).

__Now updated for Ghost 0.5.__

Used frameworks/fonts/libraries/snippets in Orre:
* [Fira Sans font](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefox-os/typeface/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon font
* [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
* Most animations with the help from [Dan Eden's Animate.css](https://daneden.me/animate/)
* A scrolling function from [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/)

Orre works best with Ghost 0.5 and has been tested on Safari 7, Google Chrome 31, Firefox 26 and mobile Safari on iOS 7.

For a live demo of the theme, go to my personal site [laketa.com](http://laketa.com).
